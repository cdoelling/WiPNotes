We are cash poor in the currency of cool

-- B2D

Dev Marketing is different, even from academia
B2D and Dev Experience (DX)
How easy are you making it for them (paella exercise) and what are the requirements

Devs are different
- Individuals and companies
- Tech and Young and Male
- Likes to share
- Creators
- Learn by doing

Time is a devs currency, be easy and productive
Your word doesn't mean anything compared to the word of a friend or colleague
Best dev marketing tool is other devs
Make the community personal
Passionate people with high bullshit detectors

Dev Program Components
1 Goals and Objectives
2 Underlying Products & Services
3 Measurement Tracking and Analysis
4 Outreach and Promo
5 Dev Engagement
6 Dev Enablement & support

Being able to pivot as the pilot moves forward

Program needs to be in a place where it has the diverse resources needed

We need to take dev input seriously and capture it in a source that allows us to evaluate beyond our opinions

open Source vs open Innovation
- Can add more value and making things easier to contribute, but with API's its in inherently open

3-Degrees of Open Source
1 Open
2 Proprietary with open components
3 Free and available repos

-- SEGMENTATION
Various different sources, closer to 40+M Globally across all languages
Every developer is a hobbyist
Enterprises inherently discourage full stack development

Segmentation Categories:
- Technology Requirements
- Individual Skills/Exp
- Business/Industry Focus
- Market/Geo

->Tech: Native
->Skills: Fear of oAuth & Security experience of mobile apps
->Focus: Must be a Mobile API Gateway Customer and large enterprise
->Market: NA & Europe

MAS Personas:
- High Dev Skills: Off Loaders (Off loading the work and easing the pain)
- Low Coder: Power Ups
- Architect/Pm: Value Seekers

-- ONBOARDING & GATEWAY
Usually comes up too early, is process onerous, no benefits and can hide information
Post awareness in the exploration learning phase
Crucial to minimize the hurdles and friction but also has more control
Devs are resistant to traditional marketing, the proof is in the pudding and exp trumps verbiage
92% of devs are part of purchasing decision or the IT buying process by Developer Media Survey

7 Point Onboarding Review
1. First Impression - Make it easy & who is it for.  Nail the value prop.
2. Product Messaging - Expand Value Prop, WIIFM
3. Examples and Case Studies - External Validation
4. Registration - Mostly one sided and less is more
5. Getting Started - Easy onboarding
6. Docs and Support - Make sure support goes somewhere and is answered by someone
7. Libraries and SDK - Attributing back to individuals in the community and support the right platforms

-- STACKOVERFLOW
Integrate within websites, saying what tags we follow and support

-- GITHUB
Social graph of who follows who and identifying who uses the "MAS" moniker in projects for cases

--EVENTS
- HACKATHONS: More people less return, keep private for best return
Think about sponsoring a team to compete in very visible hackathons like Tech Crunch Disrupt
